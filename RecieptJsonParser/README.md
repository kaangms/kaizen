# RecieptJsonParser ‚Äî Receipt OCR JSON Parser

## üìù Problem

A scanned receipt image is processed by an OCR SaaS API, returning a JSON response containing:
- `description`: The recognized text string
- `boundingPoly.vertices`: The coordinates of the text's bounding box on the image

The goal is to reconstruct the text lines **as they visually appear** on the receipt image by parsing and organizing this JSON accurately.

---

## üîß Implementation

- **Input:** A JSON array of OCR blocks with description and bounding box data
- **Output:** A plain text file where each line reflects the physical order on the receipt
- **Sorting Strategy:**
  - Sort text blocks by vertical (Y) position to group them into lines
  - Within each group, sort by horizontal (X) position to reconstruct complete lines

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- `OcrService.ReadFileData()`: Main method to convert and organize the input JSON
- Robust coordinate clustering logic with tolerance to handle OCR deviations
- Structured line output written directly to `.txt`

## ‚ùì Note on Filtering Text Blocks

Although no issue was directly encountered during parsing, a potential problem could arise from irregular bounding box sizes in the OCR JSON ‚Äî particularly if product boxes were significantly smaller or larger than the average height.

### üîç Question:
**What should be done if product bounding boxes are significantly smaller or larger than the average height?**

### ‚úÖ Answer:

Inspired by Tesseract's internal logic (see references below), the following thresholds were used:

- If a bounding box is **larger than 2√ó the average height**, it is considered *noise* and filtered out.
- If a bounding box is **smaller than 0.5√ó the average height**, it is also considered non-textual or irrelevant.

These thresholds are derived from:
- Tesseract whitepaper: *An overview of the Tesseract OCR Engine*, Section 5‚Äì8 ‚Äî Baseline Fitting and Word Detection
- Tesseract source code references:
  - [kMaxTableCellXheight = 2.0](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/ade0dfaa8cc1b12341286aa91e11f8ab77a035ad/src/textord/tablefind.cpp#L81)
  - [kAllowBlobHeight = 0.3](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/ade0dfaa8cc1b12341286aa91e11f8ab77a035ad/src/textord/tablefind.cpp#L56)

Filtered items are stored under `BlobFilteredOcrTextBlocks`.

Only the remaining OCR blocks ‚Äî suitable in size ‚Äî are used to construct a baseline and then grouped into lines via `lineOcrTextBlockDictionary`.

Once all valid blocks are processed, remaining blobs (if any) are appended to the end of the output for completeness.

## üß≠ Understanding the Vertex Index Order

Each OCR block in the JSON includes a `boundingPoly.vertices` array, which contains the coordinates of the rectangle surrounding a piece of text.

### üî¢ Vertex Index Convention

The typical order of the 4 vertices is:

| Index | Description        |
|-------|--------------------|
| 0     | Top-left corner    |
| 1     | Top-right corner   |
| 2     | Bottom-right corner|
| 3     | Bottom-left corner |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Usage

```csharp
OcrService.WriteToText();
```
