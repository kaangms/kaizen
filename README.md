# Kaizen Backend Case Study

This repository presents my solutions to the two backend case study problems provided by Kaizen, prepared as part of the application process for the Backend Developer role.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

- **Language:** C#
- **Structure:** Each question has been addressed in a dedicated project to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- **Design Philosophy:** I focused on clean, maintainable, and testable code with an emphasis on algorithmic correctness and performance.
- **Important Note:** In line with the case requirements, no database, cache, or external storage has been used for code validation in Question 1.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This case study was completed as part of my application for a Backend Developer position at Kaizen. My goal was to demonstrate:

- Strong problem-solving skills
- Attention to detail and requirements
- Proficiency in C# and backend architecture
- Ability to write production-ready, scalable code

For more details on each case and implementation, please refer to the individual project documentation files above.

Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to discussing this further!
